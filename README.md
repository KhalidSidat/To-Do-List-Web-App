# To-Do List Web App

This is a simple To-Do List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

I created this project while following a YouTube tutorial ([link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG2LXxILAnM)) to learn the fundamentals of building interactive web applications.  

Key Features:
- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Persist tasks using localStorage
- Responsive design with modern CSS styling

This project helped me understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage in JavaScript, and serves as a demonstration of my front-end development skills.
